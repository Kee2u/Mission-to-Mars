# Mission-to-Mars
In this project, I scraped different websites to gather information on Mars. I used chrome developer tools to read HTML, Beautiful Soup and Splinter to automate the scrape, Mongo to store the data and Flask to display the scraped content.

## Data Sources

 - Mars news from NASA : https://mars.nasa.gov/news/
 - Featured Image : https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html
 - Mars Facts Table : https://space-facts.com/mars/
 - Mars Hemispheres : https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
